;    your default for that operation.

; find.showcats
; If not specified or set to '0', results of a search will be sorted according
; to the distace from the searched-for string. If set to '1', all results will
; be sorted according to what catagory they're in, and the catagory name will
; be printed before all results in that catagory.
;
; find.edits
; How many characters that may be replaced to try to match a value. May be good
; if you're not sure of how it's spelled. Warning: When searching for a value
; of few characeters (less than five or so), even a low number here will match
; -a lot- of items, so keep that in mind. Hard coded highest for edits is 10.
