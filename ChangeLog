	  use format_text_in()

Fri Oct  2 20:39:45 CEST 2009: scorch
	* introduced per category duplicate policies which can handle somewhat
	  comlicated relations. There are three different policies which may
	  be used at the time; 0, 1 and 2.
	    0, don't add to this category if the item already exists in any
	       other (or this) category)
	    1, don't add to this category if the item already exists in -this-
	       category, but will add if it already exists in another category
	    2, add even if the item already exists in this and/or another
	       category
	    Example
	  If category A has policy 1, and category B has policy 0, and we add
	  an item which exists in category A to category B, this usually
	  wouldn't be allowed, sine B has policy 0, but because the duplicate
	  is in category A with policy 1 (which allows duplicates in -other-
	  categories), the item will be added to category B anyway.
